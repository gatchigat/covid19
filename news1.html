                                            MANILA, Philippines – Infections continue to decline in the Philippines,
                                            with all regions in the country now “minimal
                                            risk” for COVID-19. Hospital admissions for critical to severe cases have
                                            also dropped from 1,874 in mid-January to 805
                                            in the recent week.

                                            Roughly 60% of Filipinos are fully vaccinated. Among the 43.8 million people
                                            eligible for boosters, 11.6 million have
                                            gotten their additional shot.

                                            Here’s what we’re watching this week:</p>

                                                that two doses of the vaccine generated immune responses (among infants

                                                years) similar to those seen among adults aged 18 to 25.</li>
                                            <li class="mb-2">But the two dose regimen had a lower efficacy in preventing

                                                compared to results seen in earlier trials for
                                                older groups. In the context of Omicron, Moderna said the results of the
                                                trials for this age group would be on par with
