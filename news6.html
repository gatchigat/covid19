                                            may cause diseases in humans and other animals. Although
                                            experts first identified coronaviruses in the mid-1900s, they have likely
                                            existed for thousands of years. Scientists
                                            first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. Other sources report
                                            identifying coronaviruses as early as 1937. They are
                                            closely monitored by public health officials. It caused a common cold. Later
                                            that decade, researchers found a group of
                                            similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like
                                            appearance.</p>
                                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Scientists call the viruses with these changes “variants”.
                                            They are still SARS-CoV-2, but may act differently. The first
                                            known infections from SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The
                                            original source of viral transmission to humans
                                            remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after
                                            the spill over event. The official names
                                            COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.

                                            &lpar;SARS-CoV-2&rpar; is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
                                            coronavirus.
                                            It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the
                                            cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in
                                            Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur
                                            in related coronaviruses in nature.

                                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It is normal for viruses to change and evolve as they
                                            spread between people over time. When these changes become
                                            significantly different from the original virus, they are known as
                                            “variants.” To identify variants, scientists map the
                                            genetic material of viruses &lpar;known as sequencing&rpar; and then look

                                            differences between them to see if they have
                                            changed. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, has
                                            been spreading globally, variants have emerged
                                            and been identified in many countries around the world.

                                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Viruses are constantly evolving and changing. Every time a
                                            virus replicates &lpar;makes copies of itself&rpar;, there is the
                                            potential for there to be changes in its structure. Each of these changes is
                                            a “mutation.” A virus with one or more
                                            mutations is called a “variant” of the original virus. Some mutations can
                                            lead to changes in important characteristics
                                            of the virus, including characteristics that affect its ability to spread

                                                interim results from two clinical trials showed
