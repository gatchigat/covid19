                                creation of antibodies. These
                                antibodies will provide protection once a person is infected with the actual

                                            No vaccine provides 100% protection from COVID-19. It typically takes a
                                            few
                                            weeks for the body to build immunity after
                                            vaccination. That means it is possible a person could be infected with
                                            the
                                            virus that causes COVID-19 just before or
                                            just after vaccination and still get sick because the vaccine has not
                                            had
                                            enough time to provide protection.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>In addition, efficacy is measured not only by a vaccine's ability to
                                            prevent
                                            infection, but also in its prevention of
                                            severe forms of the disease and of forward transmission. While a
                                            vaccinated
                                            person may not be completely prevented from
                                            getting infected, s/he will still have a reduced risk of getting severe
                                            forms of COVID-19. If more people have this
                                            reduced risk, then we can more effectively reduce transmission.</p>
